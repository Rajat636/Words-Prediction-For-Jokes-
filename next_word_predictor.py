You have to make all your monthly payments on our website. Here is the link for our website - https://learnwith.campusx.in/
Can we pay the entire amount of Rs 5600 all at once?
Unfortunately no, the program follows a monthly subscription model.
What is the validity of monthly subscription? Suppose if I pay on 15th Jan, then do I have to pay again on 1st Feb or 15th Feb
15th Feb. The validity period is 30 days from the day you make the payment. So essentially you can join anytime you don’t have to wait for a month to end.

You get a 7 days refund period from the day you have made the payment.

This one is tricky, so read carefully. You can watch the videos till your subscription is valid. Suppose you have purchased subscription on 21st Jan, you will be able to watch all the past paid sessions in the period of 21st Jan to 20th Feb. But after 21st Feb you will have to purchase the subscription again.
But once the course is over and you have paid us Rs 5600(or 7 installments of Rs 799) you will be able to watch the paid sessions till Aug 2024.

Because of the low course fee.

I have read that Placement assistance is a part of this program. What comes under Placement assistance?
This is to clarify that Placement assistance does not mean Placement guarantee. So we dont guarantee you any jobs or for that matter even interview calls. So if you are planning to join this course just for placements, I am afraid you will be disappointed. Here is what comes under placement assistance

*   More Data
*   Hyperparameter tuning


*  Advanced architectue should be used like: stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer model etc.
